          It summarises the idea of <b>systemic immunity</b> and how this exact-match

        <h2>1. What do we mean by “systemic immunity”?</h2>
        <p class="muted">
          In biology, systemic immunity refers to the organism-wide capacity to recognise,
          contain and remember threats, beyond local responses. By analogy, <b>systemic
          immunity</b> is used for whole systems — financial, economic, climatic, digital,
          institutional — to describe their ability to <b>anticipate, absorb, adapt to and
          transform through compounded shocks</b> rather than simply survive them.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          SystemicImmunity.com focuses on this shift from a narrow
          <b>“systemic risk”</b> lens (losses, contagion, capital buffers) to a broader
          <b>“systemic immunity”</b> lens (adaptive capacity, redundancy, diversity,
          learning, institutional trust). It provides a short, memorable banner that can
          connect communities which usually work in silos: finance, climate, cyber,
          democracy, human rights and critical infrastructure.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Why does it matter between 2025 and 2035?</h2>
        <p class="muted">
          The coming decade is widely described as an era of <b>polycrisis</b>, where
          climate disruption, pandemics, systemic cyber incidents, geopolitical
          tensions and institutional fragility can interact. Traditional macroprudential
          and risk-management frameworks are necessary but often insufficient to
          capture these long-horizon, cross-sector dynamics.
        </p>
        <ul class="list muted">
          <li><b>Policy relevance:</b> central banks, supervisors and ministries already work on
              systemic risk, resilience and “too-big-to-fail” issues. SystemicImmunity.com
              offers a positive, forward-looking framing that emphasises <b>capacity-building</b>
              rather than fear of collapse.</li>
          <li><b>Cross-cutting potential:</b> the name is broad enough to host joint work
              across finance, climate, cyber, governance and social stability, without
              being captured by a single institution or product line.</li>
          <li><b>Communication value:</b> for Boards, parliaments and publics, “systemic
              immunity” is easier to explain than a long list of unrelated risks and ratios.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Illustrative use cases</h2>
        <p class="muted">
          The domain can accommodate very different governance models
          (public, private, hybrid, academic). Examples include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list muted">
          <li><b>Systemic Immunity Lab</b> — a joint initiative between a central bank,
              supervisors, universities and think tanks, exploring combined scenarios
              (climate + cyber + markets + politics), buffers and institutional design.</li>
          <li><b>Systemic Immunity Dashboard</b> — an online observatory aggregating
              indicators on capital &amp; liquidity, climate and disaster exposure, cyber
              preparedness, social and institutional fragility, rule of law and trust.</li>
          <li><b>Systemic Immunity Forum</b> — an annual public–private meeting that
              convenes central banks, ministries, regulators, insurers, investors, cities
              and civil society to discuss stress scenarios, lessons learned and reforms.</li>
          <li><b>“Systemic Immunity for States &amp; Cities” programme</b> — a neutral
              interface helping countries, regions or cities map vulnerabilities and build
              resilience roadmaps, coordinating public, private and philanthropic finance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="muted">
          All use-case examples are strictly <b>illustrative</b>. Any concrete initiative,
          methodology or product developed under SystemicImmunity.com would be
          designed and governed entirely by the acquirer.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. How does SystemicImmunity.com relate to other assets?</h2>
        <p class="muted">
          Depending on strategy, SystemicImmunity.com may be used on a standalone
          basis or combined with other descriptive domains (for example:
          <b>ImmunityCapital.com</b>, <b>PlanetarySolvency.com</b>, <b>ClimateSolvency.com</b>,
          <b>NatureSolvency.com</b>, <b>ComputeSovereignty.com</b>, <b>AutomationSovereignty.com</b>).
          Such combinations could underpin a broader <b>“Systemic Resilience &amp; Solvency Stack”</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">
          Any bundle or joint use would however require a separate discussion and
          agreement. By default, the asset offered for sale is solely the
          <b>SystemicImmunity.com</b> domain name.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Legal & responsibility framework (summary)</h2>
        <ul class="list muted">
          <li>The seller transfers only the <b>SystemicImmunity.com</b> domain name.</li>
          <li>No regulated banking, insurance, investment, advisory, clinical or rating
              services are provided under this site.</li>
          <li>The acquirer is fully responsible for any tools, indices, models, scenarios,
              dashboards or programmes developed under the domain, and for complying
              with all applicable laws, regulations and best practices.</li>
          <li>This Concept Note and the Acquisition Brief are <b>not</b> a prospectus and do
              not create any affiliation with institutions mentioned as potential users.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Next steps & contact</h2>
        <p class="muted">
          A typical acquisition process includes: initial contact, NDA if required,
          conceptual discussions, letter of intent / formal offer, escrow-based transfer
          and optional public communication.
